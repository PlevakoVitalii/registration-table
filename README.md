## Registration-table

![](https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/star-wars-react-app/blob/master/readme-image.png)

Deployed registration-table here [Registration-table](https://plevakovitalii.github.io/star-wars-react-app/star-wars-react/).

Implemented functionality:

- the table contains the data stored in the Store (use @reduxjs/tookit to store and manage the data);
- popup implemented using react-hook-form;
- Application typed with TypeScript.

In this project I mastered:

- react-create-app
- React
- TypeScript
- reduxjs/toolkit
- react-hook-form
- npm gh-pages

All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`

You can run this project locally just do:

- clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/registration-table.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
